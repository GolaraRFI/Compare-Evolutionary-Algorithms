# Compare Evolutionary Algorithms

## Comparison of Evolutionary Algorithms (Evolution Strategies, PSO, Differential Evolution)

This project is conducted on **Google Colaboratory**.

In this project, we have implemented three different Evolutionary Algorithms: Evolution Strategies, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution. These algorithms are evaluated using three distinct Cost Functions: Rastrigin, Schwefel, and Griewangk.

To visualize and analyze the performance of these algorithms, you can refer to the notebook `EC_functions_plot.ipynb`, where we provide two-dimensional plots demonstrating the behavior and results of the algorithms.

Feel free to explore the notebook for a deeper understanding of how these Evolutionary Algorithms perform on various Cost Functions.
